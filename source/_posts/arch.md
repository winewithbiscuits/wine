I have recently shifted to arch linux as my main os of choice.

The main reason being the windows 11 being unoptimied for my day to day work flow.
I have been using ubuntu as my work os for quite sometime as dual boot on my laptop, but now I have decided to discard windows once and for all.

I hope to navigate the installation process sometime later, via edit to this post. But for now I just wanted to use it as it is.
I have install KDE Plasma X11 as my DE.

PS: Using Pacman for almost all repo and AUR for other is so convinent.
