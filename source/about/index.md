Hello
I am winewithbiscuits, a struggling Master Student
This is my personal website

Currently focusing on learning some of the tools and techniques used in solving biological structures at near-atomic resolutions(Not going well).

In my free time, I watch youtube most of the time, and sometimes I read manga/light novels depending on my mood.
Playing truck sim 2 before bed has become like a ritual for me.
