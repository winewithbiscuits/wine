Hello
I am winewithbiscuits, Research Associate in Structural Biological Science
This is my personal website

Currently focusing on learning some of the tools and techniques used in solving biological structures at near-atomic resolutions, and protein characterisation.

In my free time, I watch youtube and also like to play games.
Playing truck sim 2 before bed has become like a ritual for me.
