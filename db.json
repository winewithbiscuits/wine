various scientific fields, particularly in materials science and structural biology, to investigate the nanoscale and mesoscale structures of materials. By utilizing X-rays with wavelengths on the order of atomic spacing, SAXD can provide valuable insights into the arrangement, orientation, and periodicity of atoms and molecules within a sample. This method is particularly useful for studying the structural characteristics of polymers, liquid crystals, colloids, and biological macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.
