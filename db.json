various scientific fields, particularly in materials science and structural biology, to investigate the nanoscale and mesoscale structures of materials. By utilizing X-rays with wavelengths on the order of atomic spacing, SAXD can provide valuable insights into the arrangement, orientation, and periodicity of atoms and molecules within a sample. This method is particularly useful for studying the structural characteristics of polymers, liquid crystals, colloids, and biological macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. SAXD experiments typically involve analyzing the scattering patterns generated when X-rays interact with the sample, offering detailed information about its internal structure and enabling researchers to understand fundamental properties and behaviors crucial for a wide range of applications, including drug development, materials design, and nanotechnology.\n\n\nEquipment and Materials:\n\nX-ray source (usually a synchrotron or laboratory X-ray generator)\nSample holder (e.g., capillary, film, or plate)\nDetector (e.g., CCD camera or image plate)\nGoniometer or sample stage for precise angular positioning\nData analysis software (e.g., Fit2D, Igor Pro, or PyFAI)\nSafety equipment (e.g., radiation shielding, goggles)\n\nProtocol:\n\nSample Preparation: Prepare your sample in the desired form (e.g., solution, film, or powder).\n\n\nExperimental Setup:\n  Mount the sample on the sample holder, ensuring it is flat and homogeneous.\n  Align the X-ray source, sample holder, and detector to the desired geometry (usually perpendicular to the X-ray beam).\n\n\nData Collection:\n    Adjust the X-ray wavelength and intensity according to the sample characteristics.\n    Scan the sample over the desired angular range while collecting X-ray scattering data.\n    Collect background and calibration measurements for accurate data analysis.\n\n\nData Analysis:\n    Process the raw data using specialized software to obtain 1D or 2D scattering patterns.\n    Analyze the scattering patterns to extract information about the sample's nano/mesoscale structure (e.g., periodicity, orientation).\n\n\nInterpretation and Reporting:\n    Interpret the results in the context of the sample's composition and properties.\n    Compare with theoretical models or known standards for validation.\n    Report the findings in scientific publications or presentations.\n\nReferences:\n\nGlatter, O., & Kratky, O.
